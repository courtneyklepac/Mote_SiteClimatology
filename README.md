# Mote_SiteClimatology
written by Courtney Klepac, long-term temperature datasets provided by Cory Walters

This repository contains descriptive statistics, heat stress calculations (DHW, days over threshold), and plots of Mote's in-situ temperature data loggers. The eventual goal is to repopulate all stats and figures with each update of the temperature datasets, so as to have as near 'real time' temperature information for the following sites (Folders):

- NewFound Harbor (NFH)
  - [NFH_temps.html](file:///Users/courtneyk/Dropbox/My%20Mac%20(BIOL68D8)/Documents/MOTE/NFH/Mote_SiteClimatology/HOBO-testplot.html)
- Looe Nursery (bottom)
- Looe Nursery (mid)
- Looe Key #13
- Sand Key Nursery (mid)
- Eastern Dry Rocks (EDR)
- Munson Reef
